					<li>
						The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by Prime
						Minister Brian Mulroney, Mexican President Carlos Salinas, and U.S.
						President George H.W. Bush, came into effect on January 1, 1994.
					</li>
					<li>
						The NAFTA was built on the success of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade
						Agreement and provided a complement to Canada's efforts through the
						WTO agreements by making deeper commitments in some key areas.
					</li>

					<li>
						With the coming into force of the NAFTA, the world's largest free
						trade area was formed. The Agreement has brought economic growth and
						rising standards of living for people in all three countries.
					</li>

					<li>
						The NAFTA, being the first comprehensive trade agreement of its
						type, has set a valuable example of the benefits of trade
						liberalization for the rest of the world.
					</li>

					<li>
						In the event of a dispute, the NAFTA directs the governments
						concerned to seek to resolve their differences amicably through the
						NAFTA's Committees and Working Groups or other consultations. If no
						mutually acceptable solution is found, the NAFTA provides for
						dispute settlement procedures. One of the principle elements of the
						NAFTA is the establishment of a clear set of rules for dealing with
						the settlement of disputes. The NAFTA was the first agreement to
						afford cross-border investors an impartial legal tribunal to address
						differences.
					</li>

					<li>
						Under the NAFTA, tariffs on all covered goods traded between Canada
						and Mexico were eliminated in 2008. Tariffs on covered goods traded
						between Canada and the United States became duty free on January 1,
						1989, in accordance with the CUSFTA which was carried forward under
						NAFTA.
					</li>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Since 1994, NAFTA has generated economic growth and rising standards
						of living for the people of all three member countries. By
						strengthening the rules and procedures governing trade and
						investment throughout the continent, NAFTA has proven to be a solid
						foundation for building Canada's future prosperity.
					</li>
					<li>
						NAFTA has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the Canadian
						economy. It has opened up new export opportunities, acted as a
						stimulus to build internationally competitive businesses, and helped
						attract significant foreign investment.
					</li>

					<li>
						By any measure the NAFTA has been a success by serving as a basis to
						grow both trilateral and bilateral North American relationships and
						the results speak for themselves. This integration helps maximize
						our capabilities and make our economies more innovative and
						competitive.
					</li>

					<li>
						In 2016, total trilateral merchandise trade, as measured by the
						total of each country's imports from its other two NAFTA partners,
						amounted to nearly USD $1.0 trillion - more than a threefold
						increase since 1993. In 2016, NAFTA partners represented 28% of the
						world's gross domestic product (GDP) with just less than 7% of the
						world's population. Since the implementation of NAFTA, the North
						American economy has expanded, with the combined GDP for Canada, the
						U.S. and Mexico reaching USD $21.1 trillion in 2016.
					</li>

					<li>
						Cooperation through the NAFTA has created a North America where
						Canadian, American and Mexican companies do more than make and sell
						things to each other, now, our companies increasingly make things
						together.
					</li>
