		<h2>Healthy Eating for Your Heart</h2>

		Eating for a healthy heart can be as simple as adding foods to meals to make
		them more balanced, pairing alcohol with water, and ordering some veggies
		when you're at a restaurant. Keeping an eye out for whole foods and buying
		those instead of the convenient ones. For example, chicken breast vs frozen
		chicken nuggets. And choosing unsalted nuts over chips and carbonated water
		over pop. Below are some tips on how to have a healthy diet for a healthy
		heart.

		<h3>Go for whole grain foods</h3>
		Add whole grain foods to your diet: a heart-healthy diet is high in fibre.
		The good news is that it's easy to add extra fibre to your daily eating
		habits. Eat lentils and choose healthy snacks throughout your day, like this
		one: chickpeas and lime. Brown rice and oatmeal are other tasty whole grain
		foods.

		<h3>Swap a couple of essentials</h3>
		Replace regular cooking ingredients with heart-healthy options without
		compromising on taste. For example, whole grain atta (flour) for your
		roties, chapatis and naan instead of refined white flour. Use olive oil or
		canola for cooking with rather than desi ghee.

		<h3>Choose healthy protein</h3>
		Add a variety of proteins to your diet. Instead of going for red meat,
		switch it up with chicken, turkey, fish, and beans like lentils. Yup! Our
		daal/dal I(lentils) are packed with proteins as well as fibre.

		<h3>Eat fruits and veggies every day</h3>
		Men should aim to eat 8-10 servings of fruits and veggies a day. I know,
		8-10 servings may sound like a lot, like you're supposed to eat nothing but
		fruits and vegetables all day every day. But, it doesn't need to be like
		that; 1 serving is smaller than you think. A half a cup of fresh, frozen or
		canned vegetables equals 1 serving. The same with half a cup of cooked
		vegetables or half a cup of frozen or canned fruit. Have you looked at
		measuring cups lately? A half a cup on average is smaller than half the size
		of your fist.

		<h3>Divide your plate into three portions</h3>

		A straightforward way to make your meals a little more heart-healthy is to
		divide your plate into three portions, one for each item: protein, carbs and
		greens. If you're having a parata, that's carbs, add an omelet with lots of
		veggies, and you have the protein with the greens—done and done. A healthy
		plate looks like this: * ½ of the plate is fruits and vegetables. * ¼ is
		whole grains. * is healthy protein. On the other hand, if you have aloo
		parata which is carb-on-carb deep-fried, try having half of one and consider
		eating a salad or a smoothie with it for extra fibre and to promote a
		healthy gut.

		<h3>Eat serotonin boosting foods</h3>
		Stress can be a major cause of high blood pressure, and many of us are aware
		of the importance of reducing stress in our lives. But what you might not
		know is that there are foods that can boost the serotonin levels in your
		body. Serotonin is a natural chemical your body produces which makes you
		feel good. This helps reduce stress and, in turn, regulates your blood
		pressure. Serotonin also helps regulate sleep, and quality sleep can also
		lower stress. Try adding salmon, tofu, cheese, and pineapple into your diet.

		<h2>Build a Cardio Routine for Weight Loss</h2>

		Below is a chart detailing a sample week of cardio workouts for a person who
		exercises six days a week. This is simply an example of how to incorporate
		different types of cardio workouts into a typical week. Modify the workouts
		according to your own fitness level, time constraints, and preferences.
		Start slowly, if you're a beginner, and work your way up to this level of
		exercise. How much you need is based on a number of factors, including your
		fitness level, age, gender, and your goals. Be sure to warm up before each
		workout and cool down after. Stay hydrated, and stretch after your workouts.
