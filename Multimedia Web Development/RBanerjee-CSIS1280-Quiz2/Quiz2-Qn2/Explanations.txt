Zone 1 
This zone encourages the flow of blood, which is key
to maintaining a healthy heart and improving recovery
after difficult workouts.

Zone 2 
At a light intensity, this zone enhances your endurance
and increases your body’s ability to use fats and
carbohydrates as fuel.

Zone 3 
Workouts in this zone help improve your body’s
aerobic capacity, or the ability to use oxygen. This
zone also delays the fatigue caused by lactic acid.

Zone 4 
This zone improves your performance and makes
moderate intensity effort easier by improving
efficiency. Exercise in this zone is recommended for
only short periods of time.

Zone 5
The maximum zone should be used by experienced
athletes only. Short bouts in this high-intensity zone
help to develop top-end speed and overall
performance.
