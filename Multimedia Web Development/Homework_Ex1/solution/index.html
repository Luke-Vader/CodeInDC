		<h1>The Age of Mobile Apps</h1>
		<hr />
		<div>
			<pre>
A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch.</pre
			>
		</div>
		<p class="first">
			Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email,
			calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused
			rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games, factory automation,
			GPS and location-based services, order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so
			that there are now millions of apps available.
		</p>
		<p>Here is a quote from TechAhead website:</p>
		<blockquote>
			The word 'App' was voted to be the word of the year by American Dialect
			Society in 2010. This shows how apps became popular after the launch of
			the App Store. Apps have made everything just a tap away. We are dependent
			on apps to communicate to one another, to keep everything organized and
			for entertainment too. Moreover, there are number of businesses based on
			the social media apps.

		<h2>Making Your App a Success</h2>
		<p>
			The apps market is pretty saturated. So, is it still worthwhile creating
			an app? Below are some tips to make your app successful in a saturated
			market.
		</p>
		<h3>Make it Useful to your Target Users</h3>
		<p>
			It does not matter how great your app is. If it is not useful, it is dead
			in the water. To make your app useful, it should (be):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Entertaining:</strong>
				Make sure to provide content that your target market will find
				entertaining.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Addresses a pain point:</strong>
				What pain points do your clients have? What information do they need?
				How can you address these issues with your app?
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			An app needs to be valuable to your target market so that they'll keep
			using it. What form that value needs to take depends on the target market.
			Why not ask them what they'd like to see?
		</p>
		<h3>Unique</h3>
		<p>
			There are millions of apps out there. If your app is just a copy of
			another, don't bother. It must offer something unique. There is a saying,
			<q><em>There's an app for that.</em></q> You want yours to offer something
			that no one else's can.
		</p>
		<h3>Easy to Use</h3>
		<p>
			How many people would be willing to take the time to learn how to use a
			complicated app? If you want your app to become popular, make it as
			intuitive to use as possible.
		</p>
		<h3>Flawless Operation</h3>
		<p>
			Even though you could upload bug fixes and patches later, it may be too
			late. How many times have you downloaded an app only to find that it
			doesn't work as advertised? Do you wait around for the bugs to be fixed or
			do you delete it to make room on your phone? Keep your app simple and make
			sure that it runs flawlessly.
		</p>
		<h3>Cross-Platform</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Advances in information technology imply that there are many platforms to
			choose from - Mac, Windows, Linux, Android-based operating system,
			iOS-based system, and so on. For mobile apps, it is hard to find an app
			that will work across Android and iOS. The best solution to this problem
			is to ensure that you have a working app for both systems.
