	<h1>Glossary of Cardio Exercise Terms</h1>

<dl>
<p>
<dt>Energy Systems</dt>
<dd>There are 3 energy systems that power our exercise activity (1) phosphagen, (2) glycolitic 1, and (3) aerobic. The phosphagen system is engaged during exercise bouts of less than 10 seconds, the glycolitic system predominates in exercise bouts of less than 2 minutes, and the aerobic system predominates for longer duration exercise, typically 5 minutes or more.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Aerobic Exercise</dt>
<dd>Aerobic exercise is an activity that requires energy production with oxygen and is the 3rd energy system. If you’re doing aerobic exercise then you’re sending oxygen, through your breath, to your muscles giving them the energy to sustain your exercise. You’re conditioning your heart and lungs by enabling your heart to use your oxygen more efficiently.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Anaerobic Exercise</dt>
<dd>Anaerobic Exercise is an activity that requires energy production without oxygen and comprise the first two energy systems (phosphagen and glycolitic). If you’re doing anaerobic exercise, because you are training at your maximum level of exertion, you’re not sending enough oxygen to your muscles to sufficiently sustain the effort. For this reason, your body builds up lactic acid. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Max Heart Rate (HRmax)</dt>
<dd>The highest heart rate you can safely reach through physical exertion. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Target Heart Rate</dt>
<dd>The optimal heart rate at which an athlete should perform a particular sport activity, determined by a formula that bases training intensity zones on heart rates as percentages of max heart rate. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Cool Down</dt>
<dd>This is the phase of an exercise routine in which you to slow down, recover, and reduce your heart rate. A cool down will help you get oxygen to the muscles as well as get rid of waste products such as lactic acid. Depending on the intensity and duration of the workout a cool down can last anywhere from 2-15 minutes. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>VO2 Max</dt>
<dd>This is a measure of cardiovascular health and fitness: its name is derived from V (volume) and O2 (oxygen). It is the maximum capacity of an individual’s body to transport & use oxygen during incremental exercise, reflecting the phsical fitness of the individual. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Aerobic Capacity</dt>
<dd>This is the highest amount of oxygen consumed during maximal exercise (especially in activities that incorporate large muscle groups), meaning, is the maximum amount of oxygen a body can use in an exercise session.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Hitting the Wall (aka Bonking)</dt>
<dd>This is a condition caused by the depletion of glycogen stores in the liver and muscles, which manifests itself by sudden fatigue and loss of energy.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Glycogen</dt>
<dd>This is a polysaccharide (form in which most natural carbohydrates occur) that serves as a form of energy storage: glycogen is stored so it can be broken down into glucose for fuel. It is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and the muscles in humans.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Cross Training</dt>
<dd>A method of training that aims to combine exercises that work various parts of the body as often one particular activity works certain muscle groups, but not others.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>High Intensity Interval Training</dt>
<dd>This is a method of training that involves a series of low to high-intensity exercise workouts interspersed with rest or relief periods. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Fartlek Training</dt>
<dd>This is a type of training method that blends continuous training with interval training. This system taxes both the aerobic and anaerobic systems because of its varying intensities and continuous work output. It differs from traditional Interval training in that is unstructured and sprint and rest times can vary throughout the entirety of 30-45-minute session.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Tabata Training</dt>
<dd>This is a type of interval training that follows a specific format: 20 seconds of a very high intensity exercise (e.g., sprints) with 10 seconds of rest where you repeat 8 times for a total of 4 minutes.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>Steady State Cardio</dt>
<dd>This is simply a cardio workout that is a continuous, steady effort, as opposed to an interval cardio workout where you vary your energy output.</dd> </p>
