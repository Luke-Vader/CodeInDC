				<h2>What Is Cardio?</h2>

				<p>
					<span>Cardiovascular exercises</span> are physical activities that aim
					to improve the heart and lungs' endurance by increasing the oxygen
					intake and circulation in the body. Cardio is one of the two main
					types of workouts: aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Both types of
					exercise are essential for a healthy brain and body. They can also
					help people who are trying to lose weight.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>Anaerobic exercise</span> involves high-intensity movements.
					These movements work your muscles so hard that you can only sustain
					them in short bursts.
				</p>
				<p>Examples of anaerobic exercises:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sprinting</li>
					<li>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</li>
					<li>Weightlifting</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					<span>Aerobic exercise</span> is also known as cardio. Cardio workouts
					involve the use of the larger muscle groups and activities that
					require repetitive movements for an extended period. Unlike anaerobic
					exercise, our bodies can sustain these workouts for lengthier periods.
					Cardiovascular exercises work by increasing the heart rate and
					breathing rate, facilitating the blood flow and oxygen supply to the
					muscles' cells.
				</p>

				<p>Examples of aerobic exercises:</p>
				<!-- An unordered list-->
				<ul>
					<li>Taking the stairs</li>
					<li>Mowing the lawn</li>
					<li>Cycling</li>
					<li>Rowing</li>

						reduces the risk of premature death.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="ol">Improved cognitive function</span><br />
						Cardio exercises can improve cognitive function by enhancing blood
						flow and oxygen to the brain. This leads to better focus,
						concentration, and overall mental clarity. Exercising regularly also
						enhances brain function and cognitive abilities, improving memory,
						focus, and decision-making skills.
					</li>
